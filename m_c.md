# Molding and Casting

First, I will do molding for the mold model. I used the Mold Star Silicone Rubber. There are 2 bottles labeled A and B. The ratio for molding is 1:1.

Before starting, I need to cover the workspace with tissue as it gets messy. I also need to wear plastic gloves. Please use the correct gloves as the compund may react to the gloves. Then I poured the compunds into a plastic cup. Since I'm doing the mold together with a friend, we used 50g each of A and B.

After that, I mixed the compounds well before putting it in the vacuum chamber. This will remove any bubbles in the compound, ensuring that the mold surface would be smooth.

After degassing, I poured the compound into the mold. Ensure that the entire mold is filled. The instructions stated that the curing takes up to 4hrs but I decided to leave it overnight to ensure maximum curing.
