# 2D Controlled Computer Machining

# Assignment

We were tasked to design something big and fabricate it using the CNC machine

I wanted to design a rig for my racing wheel simulator.

1. Strong and sturdy
2. Adjustable
3. Able to fold down for storing

I used fusion360 to design the rig. I used slotting to fasten components together. The CNC machine is similar to the laser cutter we used during dfab1, hence I designed it in that way. The design is quite simple and easy to fabricate. When designing, I need to add dogbone to sharp edges. This is to compensate for the tool bit diameter. Once I'm done with designing, it is time for machining. It's basically  telling the machine how to cut the workpiece. I've done Mastercam so I'm familiar with the process. After finalizing the machining process, we'll need to generate the g-code.
