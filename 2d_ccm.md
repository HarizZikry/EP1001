# 2D Controlled Computer Machining

# Assignment

We were tasked to design something big and fabricate it using the CNC machine

I wanted to design a rig for my racing wheel simulator.

1. Strong and sturdy
2. Adjustable
3. Able to fold down for storing

I used fusion360 to design the rig. I used slotting to fasten components together. The CNC machine is similar to the laser cutter we used during dfab1, hence I designed it in that way. The design is quite simple and easy to fabricate.

When designing, I need to add dogbone to sharp edges, as shown below. This is to compensate for the tool bit diameter.

Once I'm done with designing, I'll need to prepare the design for machining. I add a 1200mm by 1200mm stock at the base. I use the move function to arrange all the components in such a way where it all aligns and fits in the stock size.

It is now ready for machining. It's basically  telling the machine how to cut the workpiece. I've done Mastercam so I'm familiar with the process. I need to do two operations, drilling and contour. After finalizing the machining process, we'll need to generate the g-code.
